# Adult Screening for Autism

I wanted to apply and understand better how one can apply a Machine Learning model in the real world. <br> 

One of my topics of interests is Autism. Because of personal experience, I am curious why the process in detecting Autism is not robust. I am not an expert on this topic but the way I understand it, the detection process involves checklist and an expert opinion. <br>

The dataset comes from Dr. Fadi Fayez Thabtah which was uploaded into [Kaggle - Autism Screening](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faizunnabi/autism-screening) <br>

The topic here is a Classification task. This is because I need to classify who has Autism and who does not have it. <br>

To see the analysis done in Jupyter notebook, please see it here [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shafierahim/autism-adult-screening) <br>
